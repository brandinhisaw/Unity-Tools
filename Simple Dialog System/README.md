# Simple Dialog System

The initial version of my Simple Dialog System which inherits from the abstract Dialog Class to branch out from only Simple to more advanced dialog navigation in the future.

Features:
  Prompts, a simple text box Scriptable Object that can be used to store dialog text.
  Displays text as a typed-out style animation.
  Built-in skip to end feature when using input button during animation.
